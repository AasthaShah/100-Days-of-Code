# 100-Days-of-Code
This is a repository where I will pick up data structures and some important MUST-DO code questions from levels easy to hard! This repository can help anyone who wants to gain sufficient knowledge and excel in her/his career.


Whats the plan?

1.Some days will be alloted to each data structure. The coding will begin from the basics where basic operations like insert, update, delete and create will be explored in multiple languages. 
2.After understanding the basics, we will explore some problems from basics to hard level of difficulty. In that, we can understand how to use a single data structure in multiple ways.
3.After understanding and playing around with these data structures, we can jump directly into random problems and understand which data structure can suit where.

Hoping this repository helps people who are struggling to find out where to begin, how to proceed and where to go!

All the best, Happy Hardworking! ;)
